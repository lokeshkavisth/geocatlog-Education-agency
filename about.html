              But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
              pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
              account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
              great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
              happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
              because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
              pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
              extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues
              or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
              because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
              can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
              which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
              obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
              with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
              consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
              pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
              indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by
              the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
              they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue;
              and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
              weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking
              from toil and pain.

              One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
              himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on
              his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
              see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
              stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed
              ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
              compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly
              as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a
              dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small,
              lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of
              textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a
              travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he
              had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a
              nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and
              fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the
              whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
