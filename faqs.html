              <h3>How much does a website cost?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  While we would love to be able to give a definitive, fixed
                  price for a website, it really depends on the specific needs
                  for each individual business. If one business needs a website
                  comprised of five pages, while another has a substantially
                  larger site of over 100 pages - obviously those projects are
                  going to command different price points.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With that being said - here are some general guidelines on
                  what to expect from a pricing standpoint.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you can get by with a small website (between 3 - 10 pages)
                  using a pre-designed template, you can expect to pay
                  approximately $2,500.00. A mid-sized website that has anywhere
                  from 11 - 25 pages, but still uses a pre-made template, will
                  be between $3,000.00 - $5,000.00. If you have a lot of pages,
                  are looking for something completely custom, or are looking
                  for something that has special functionality such as
                  eCommerce, custom calculators, or integrations with other
                  services, you may be looking at anywhere from $10,000 -
                  $20,000.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Ultimately, the takeaway here is that we can accommodate
                  projects of just about any budget - so long as expectations
                  are set accordingly.

              <h3>Are there any monthly fees?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  This will vary depending on the type of project. For logo &
                  branding projects, fees will be one-time costs. For website
                  projects, we will typically charge a monthly fee, depending on
                  the level of service you choose. To view a full list of our

              <h3>How much does a logo cost?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>Logo projects typically cost between $3,000 - $5000.</p>
                <p>
                  "Why so much?" many people ask. To answer simply - because
                  they require a lot of work. At least, to do them properly. And
                  of all of the investments that you will make for your
                  business, your logo & branding is one area where you don't
                  want to skimp.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In business, image is everything. And while your overall brand
                  is based on far more than just your logo, a bad logo can
                  create a strong first impression (for better or for worse).
                </p>

                <p>
                  A properly designed logo requires hours of research, and
                  hundreds of sketches and iterations. And with an increasing
                  number of branded businesses in the world, doing research to
                  verify that your mark is unique is a tedious yet necessary
                  part of the process.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With each logo project that we complete, we provide 3 - 5
                  unique logo concepts, a branding guide that details how to
                  properly use the logo, several versions of the logo that are
                  print-ready, and can be sent to any printer or publisher for
                  easy use, detailed color schemes, typography & associated
                  fonts, and design samples of your new logo.

                What separates Right Creative from other top design agencies in
                the area?
              </h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>Experience, quality, and results.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Experience.</strong> We have been designing websites
                  professional since the early days of the web - before CSS was
                  mainstream, and people still used tables for their website
                  layouts. In the 20+ years that we have been doing this, we
                  have work with and learned from many of the top voices in
                  several industries. To put it simply - there are very few
                  people in the world, let alone the area that can top our years
                  of experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Quality</strong> At Right Creative, we hold an almost
                  unrealistic standard for quality. We demand excellence in
                  every project we take on, and firmly believe that the quality
                  of our work demonstrates our commitment to these standards.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Results</strong> More than anything else, our focus
                  is, and will always be getting results for clients. We don't
                  care how pretty something is - if it is not resulting in the
                  growth or obtaining of goals for our clients, then it is not
                  time or money well spent. Our mission is to turn visitors into
                  paying customers - and every decision that we make is rooted
                  in that mission.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Other distinguishing features</strong> Some of the
                  other things that separate Right Creative from other top-rated
                  agencies are: we hand-code all of our websites for maximum
                  results. We don't rely on Wordpress, plugins, templates or
                  themes to accomplish things, and are therefore not locked in
                  to the limits they pose.

              <h3>We're just starting out. How can we afford your services?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  We started this business from scratch, and know full-well how
                  tight money can be when you are first starting out. We
                  empathize with the struggles of new business owners, and
                  therefore work diligently so that the new businesses that we
                  work with succeed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The primary criteria we look for when working with new
                  businesses is the seriousness of the business owner. While it
                  is natural for a new business owner to be cautious with the
                  money they spend - we do look for a commitment to growth. If
                  you do not have a specific plan for how you intend to grow
                  your business, then the reality is - you will probably never
                  be in a good position to afford our services.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With that said - if you are growth-minded, then we are happy
                  to help you achieve that growth, and are willing to work with
                  you to come up with a plan that fits within your budget and
                  comfort level. Whether this is a smaller site, financing
                  options, or a payment plan - we are confident that we can
                  figure out something that will be mutually beneficial.

                What is the difference between a pre-designed site and a custom
                site?
              </h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  The difference between pre-designed and custom sites is a lot
                  like the difference between buying a home versus building a
                  home.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Pre-designed sites start with a website that has already been
                  designed and coded. These sites will allow you to customize
                  colors, fonts, photos, content, and your logo - but does not
                  allow you to rearrange, reposition, or change the layout of
                  the site. This option is great for newer businesses or
                  businesses with a smaller budget. You not only get the benefit
                  of a hand-coded, customized site, but you also benefit from a
                  smaller price tag and faster turnaround time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Custom sites are built from scratch, exactly to your
                  businesses needs. While custom sites often have a bigger price
                  tag attached to them, they are also going to be more effective
                  at converting your visitors into paying customers.
                </p>

              <h3>Can I make edits to my own website once it launches?</h3>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>
                  Yes and no. With each client that we work with, we designate
                  time to figure out what content clients will need to edit on a
                  regular basis, and create tools to allow them to do that
                  easily. For things such as news, articles, blogs, and
                  portfolios, clients will have access to the Content Management
                  System, and add/edit/delete those things as needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For other areas of the site, we request that our clients trust
                  us to make those edits, so to maintain the integrity of their
                  website.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is very common for clients who have full control over their
                  site to see it deteriorate after a while due to non-designers
                  & non-developers adding content to the site using markup &
                  styling that is not cohesive with the rest of the site. What
                  results is a website filled with pages containing
                  broken-looking content, and improperly formatted text.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Because we care about the quality of our sites, the
                  reputations of our clients, and the results that they see - we
                  prefer to let our clients be the experts at what they do - and
                  us to be the experts at what we do.
