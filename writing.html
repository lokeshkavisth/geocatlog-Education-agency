        <h1>Our Best Thesis From Our Best Students & Mentors</h1>
        <p>
          A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
          these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am
          alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created
          for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so
          absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
          neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke
          at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater
          artist than now.

              For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” haunted Barkley Cove, a
              quiet fishing village. Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for
              polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is
              found dead, locals immediately suspect her.
